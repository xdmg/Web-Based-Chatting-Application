# What is xdChat?
A realtime chatting web-app for desktop environments, provides functionality for peer-to-peer chats and end-to-end encrypted anonymous group chats. Built with the MERN (js) stack, it uses Pusherâ€™s change streams to fetch updated data in realtime from mongoDB. Firebase was used for authentication.
